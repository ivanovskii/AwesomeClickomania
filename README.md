**AwesomeClickomania** is an attempt to clone a [Clickomania](https://www.clickomania.ch/click/ClassicClick.html) game. It was created on Unreal Engine 5 using blueprints.

## The goal of the game

The goal of the game is to remove as many balls on the field as possible. Two or more balls of the same color can be removed on the field when they are next to each other. They disappear from the board and all other balls move down and to the left, occupying the vacated fields. If there are no more moves, the game is over.
